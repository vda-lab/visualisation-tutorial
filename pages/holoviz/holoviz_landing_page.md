In this tutorial, we will look into using [HoloViz](https://holoviz.org/index.html) in the specific context of using it in combination with Vega-Lite and Vega for data visualisation from python.

HoloViz brings together a group of tools to simplifies visualisation in python. These tools are:
* [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/), which we'll use for building dashboards
* [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org/), which makes it possible to very quickly create data visualisation
* [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) is a high-level plotting API built on HoloViews
* [GeoViews](http://geoviews.org/), which extends HoloViews for geographic data
* [Datashader](https://datashader.org/), which allows rendering huge datasets
* [Param](https://param.holoviz.org/), which helps to create user-configurable objects
* [Colorcet](https://colorcet.holoviz.org/), which defines perceptually uniform colormaps.

We'll be using _Panel_ and _Param_ in this tutorial, within the context of [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

Much of this tutorial is based on the excellent tutorial given by James Bednar available at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7deGS4IPAQ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7deGS4IPAQ0).
